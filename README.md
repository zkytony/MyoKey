MyoKey
======

Myo application that allows you to Copy and Paste text on Windows using gestures. 
Besides, the functionality of combinations of gestures is extendable.

Copy - finger spread + wave In

Paste - fist + finger spread

Alt+Tab (bug, not working) - finger spread + wave out

One thing about Myo, at least the one we are using, is that the 'ThumbtoPinky' gesture is hard to be recognized. One bug we need to fix is the alt+tab program-switching keys. Feel free to try out how to fix it!
